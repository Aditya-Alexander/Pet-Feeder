# Pet Feeder
 An automatic pet feeder which would be operated without the need of a human being or it can be used manually. A container will store food and it will be physically rotated by a servo motor. Arduino Mega can be used and it will be connected to a mobile based App known as “Blynk”. This application will provide both functionality and information such as detecting and notifying automatic feeding of pet, setting timer for frequent feeding, providing a button to the user to manually drop food from the container, checking food quantity on the container and notifying when food is low.
